Name: 10,000,000
Type: Match three
Score: 6/10

Name: 1000xResist
Type: Storybook
Score: 4/10
Note: Convoluted story that frontloads the world building through made up words and acts we have no connection to or insight into. Potential to be good, left the station in the opposite direction I expected and without me. Not really a game?

Score: 8/10
Note: Great plattformer, difficult and with room to be more difficult. Cute story but mostly background noise for the excellent plattforming part.
Recommended: Yes
