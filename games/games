Name: 100% Orange Juice
Type: Board Game
Score: 4/10
Note: Mario Party, but different. Might have been better with friends.

Name: 10,000,000
Type: Match three
Score: 6/10
Note: Auto-runner, match three to take actions as you progress in dungeon. Good mobile game to waste time, not much else than whats on the can.

Name: 1000xResist
Type: Storybook
Score: 4/10
Note: Convoluted story that frontloads the world building through made up words and acts we have no connection to or insight into. Potential to be good, left the station in the opposite direction I expected and without me. Not really a game?

Name: 1001 Spikes
Type: Plattformer
Score: 8/10
Note: Great plattformer, difficult and with room to be more difficult. Cute story but mostly background noise for the excellent plattforming part.
Recommended: Yes

Name: 11-11 Memories Retold
Type: Storybook
Score: 6/10
Note: Oilpainting come to life about the horrors and effects of World War 1 western front. Interesting concept, good enough story, but did not stay with you.
